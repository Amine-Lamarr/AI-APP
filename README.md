# House Price Prediction Project

Hey there! This is my very first project trying out machine learning to predict house prices.

## What I Did
I worked on cleaning the data, handling missing values, converting text data into numbers, and scaling the features.  
Then, I trained a few models like XGBoost, Random Forest, and even a simple Neural Network to see how well they could predict house prices.

## How Did It Go?
Honestly, the results aren’t perfect yet. Sometimes the predictions are a bit off or unrealistic, and that’s okay!  
This was a big learning curve for me, and I’m proud of the progress I made.

## What’s Next?
I plan to improve my data cleaning, try out different models, and get better at tuning and evaluating them.  
Each project I do will get better, and I’m excited to keep growing my skills.

## About Me
I’m Amine 18 yo , learning and experimenting with machine learning projects step by step. Thanks for stopping by!

Feel free to reach out or give feedback — I’m always open to learning more!
